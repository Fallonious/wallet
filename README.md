### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, I have:

* Created a basic Rails app.
* Created an editable table.
* Worked within MVC architecture.
* Customized submit buttons.
* Gained a working knowledge of how to sort information by record.

To accomplish this, I created a working outline of the various columns and information I wanted to to be displayed. It was necessary to manipulate the View folder in order to customize the app.
